					<div class="card__body">
						<p><b>In 2021</b>: 43 goals, 14 assists.<br> Won UEFA Nations League.</p>
						<br><p>Karim Benzema continues to go from strength to strength following Cristiano Ronaldo's departure from Real Madrid, and 2021 was arguably the best individual year of his career.</p>
						<br><p>An all-round striker who can create goals as well as he can score them, Benzema has also made a triumphant return to international football with France, with his presence ensuring they will likely head to the 2022 World Cup as favourites to defend their crown.</p>

					    <br><p>Injuries have disrupted the France international over the course of the past few years, but when he is on the pitch there is still no one better than what he does on the planet.</p>

					  <br><p>The fact that two of his three managers over the course of the year have been sacked and the third, Portugal's Fernando Santos, is hanging by a thread suggests that the teams with him in have not been quite as successful, but the five-time Ballon d'Or winner still has the capability to come up big with goals on a regular basis.</p>

					  <br><p>There is no doubt that Robert Lewandowski would have won the Ballon d'Or in 2020 had it not been controversially cancelled by France Football.</p>
					  <br><p>There is even a school of though that believes him carrying that form through into 2021 should mean he is an automatic selection to claim this year's prize.</p>
					  <br><p>The Bayern Munich star could certainly not have done any more to force himself into the reckoning.</p>

					  <p><b>In 2021:</b> 41 goals, 17 assists. Won Copa America & Copa del Rey.</p>
					  <br><p>The GOAL50 winner almost single-handedly dragged Barcelona to what would have been an unlikely La Liga title if they had got over the line during the opening months of 2021, before winning Player of the Tournament and the Golden Boot at the Copa America as the Argentine finally claimed his first major international trophy.</p>
					  <br><p>His goal record might not match that of Lewandowski's, but Ballon d'Or voters do have a magpie-like nature to them, and enjoy the sight of players lifting silverware.</p>
